      <h1>Termination</h1>
      <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
        whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
      <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
      <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers
        under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
        amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the
        Service.</p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for
        any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages
        for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
        privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software
        and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms),
        even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
        fails of its essential purpose.</p>
      <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
        consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
        party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
      <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
      <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
        without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
        behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly
        disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
        including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
        non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
        practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
        representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
        compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
        meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
        corrected.</p>
      <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation
        or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
        information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
        error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through

        Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
        statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But
        in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
        enforceable under applicable law.</p>
      <h1>Governing Law</h1>
      <p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the
        Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

      <p>If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally
        by contacting the Company.</p>
      <h1>For European Union (EU) Users</h1>
      <p>If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country
        in which you are resident in.</p>
      <h1>United States Legal Compliance</h1>
      <p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
        government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist
        supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or
        restricted parties.</p>
      <h1>Severability and Waiver</h1>
      <h2>Severability</h2>

        interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law
        and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
      <h2>Waiver</h2>
      <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
        this Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
        thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
      <h1>Translation Interpretation</h1>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
        You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
